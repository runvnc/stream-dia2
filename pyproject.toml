# Dia2 itself is installed from GitHub; this assumes you have a compiler/CUDA ready.
# You can let uv/pip install it directly from the repo like this:
#
# For uv (recommended):
#   uv add "dia2 @ git+https://github.com/nari-labs/dia2.git"
#
# Or edit [project].dependencies above to include a line like:
#   "dia2 @ git+https://github.com/nari-labs/dia2.git"
#
# Then run:
#   uv sync
#
# After that, `uv run uvicorn realtime_dia2_server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000`
# will see the dia2 module.

# Added Dia2 from GitHub as a dependency
# NOTE: uv/pip will install from this repo URL.
