[S1] Um, like, I don't know, I've never actually, like, been on a real vacation, you know? [S2] Oh, seriously? That's wild. I've, uh, only been on, like, one trip myself, and it was kinda stressful. [S1] Yeah, I always see people going places on, like, Instagram, but then I'm just, um, at home thinking, "Maybe next year." [S2] Honestly, same. I, like, plan stuff in my head but then forget or just, you know, bail at the last minute. [S1] So, we should, like, totally go somewhere together one day. [S2] For real, that would be awesome.
